# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Here is a list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size
  - School performance based on the type of school
  
## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv 
- Software: Anaconda 4.7.12, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, PythonData environment using Python 3.6

## Summary
By the end of this module, we will be able to:
- Open Jupyter Notebook files from local directories using a development environment.
- Read an external CSV file into a DataFrame.
- Format a DataFrame column.
- Determine data types of row values in a DataFrame
- Retrieve data from specific columns of a DataFrame
- Merge, filter, slice, and sort a DataFrame.
- Apply the groupby() function to a DataFrame.
- Use multiple methods to perform a function on a DataFrame.
- Perform mathematical calculations on columns of a DataFrame or Series.

## Challenge Overview
Maria and her supervisor have discovered that the score averages for ninth graders from one high school are incorrect. Maria has asked to remove the math and reading scores for that high school, but without removing those ninth-grade students from the analysis.

- Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
- Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
- Explain how your PyCity Schools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data.

## Challenge Summary
The analysis of the schools, after removing the reading and math scores, show that:
- The district summary is affected?
- The school summary is affeected?
- Removing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance?  realtive to the other schools
- Removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by:
  - Grade
  - Scores by School Spending
  - Scores by School Size
  - Scores by School Type
